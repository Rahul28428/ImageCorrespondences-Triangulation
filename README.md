# ImageCorrespondences-Triangulation

## Autonomous Systems Course Programming Assignment

This repository contains my implementation of a programming assignment from the Autonomous Systems course. The assignment focused on 3D scene reconstruction from two images using the Essential matrix estimation technique. The code finds correspondences, estimates the Essential matrix, decomposes it into camera motion and translation, and performs triangulation to compute 3D points. The implementation follows the Linear Eight-point Algorithm. The repository includes the code, input images, and a report summarizing the findings.
Go through the report to understand the implementation of the code.
