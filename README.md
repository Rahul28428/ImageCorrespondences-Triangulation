# ImageCorrespondences-Triangulation
This repository implements a computer vision algorithm for 3D scene reconstruction from two images. It finds correspondences, estimates the Essential matrix, decomposes it for camera motion, triangulates 3D points, and plots them with the camera center. Code, images, results, and detailed report are provided.
